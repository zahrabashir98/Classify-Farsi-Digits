# Classify-Farsi-Digits
I want to classify Farsi digits using ["Hoda Farsi Digit Dataset"](https://github.com/amir-saniyan/HodaDatasetReader)

Actually I used two different approaches to Train my data...
1. Implement the classifier by a MultiLayerPerceptron
* I attached the source code and the results and reports in `MLP` folder.
2. Implement the classifier by a DeepLayers(DeepLearning Tools)
* I attached the source code and the results and reports in `Deeplearning` folder.

I'll be glad if you help me doing them better ^_^
